# Ajoop - My First Unity Game (Unity Learning Project)

## 🎮 About the Project

Ajoop is my first game project created to learn the fundamentals of Unity. The game consists of **six scenes**, each emphasizing a different fundamental concept in Unity. The **sixth scene** brings together all the elements learned in previous scenes to provide a complete gaming experience.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Scene 1:** A map where you need to enter a **four-character code**. If you enter the correct code, you will be rewarded.
- **Scene 2:** A **3D platform level** with a fixed camera. This scene is designed to test physics interactions.
- **Scene 3:** A **kitchen exploration scene** where you can move around and interact with sound-based controls.
- **Scene 4:** A **short home robot simulation**, allowing players to experience basic AI and automation mechanics.
- **Scene 5:** A **2D version of Scene 4**, providing a different perspective on the home robot simulation.
- **Scene 6:** A **combination of all previous scenes**, offering players a fun mini-game experience.
